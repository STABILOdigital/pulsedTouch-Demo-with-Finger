/**
 *   An SID_Touch is the smallest unit of the SID_PulsedTouchRecognizer. It represents a touch point with its point coordinates, the timestamp of the touch and the speed between it and the most recent touch point of the same line. If the touch event starts a new line or is isolated, the velocity property is 0. On top, it includes information on the type of touch, and, if the touch event belongs to a pen line, the line identifier.
